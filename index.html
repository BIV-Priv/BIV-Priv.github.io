                        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Thank you for participating in this study! In this study, we are collecting images and videos that contain private visual content from blind people through a mobile app. Our goal is to develop tools that automatically identify and remove private information in images or videos captured by blind people, to protect their privacy when sharing visual content on social media, or to visual assistance technologies, and so on.</p>
                        <p>To protect our blind participants’ privacy, we do not ask participants to take images and videos of their own private objects. Instead, we provide a set of 14 prop objects, with fabricated private information. </p>
                        <p>Your task is to take a series of images and videos for the 14 prop objects. To make sure our tools ultimately work for people who are blind and have low vision, it is very important that you take the images and videos yourself, without help from sighted friends or family members.</p>
                        <p>In total, please expect to spend about 2 hours on this task. You may take breaks between, but please complete the task within the 24-hour period.  </p>
                        <p>On this page, you will find all information needed to take part in this study. We also provide a Zoom video call session to help you set up the study and go through any questions you may have. Please email us to schedule the Zoom session with one of our researchers. </p>

                        <h3 id="steps">Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
                        <p>To complete the task, please follow the step-by-step instructions below. Note: You'll need to complete steps 3 to 7 for each of the 14 prop objects, although there may be additional specialized instructions for some of the objects.</p>
                        <h4 id="step1">Step 1: App Installation and Walkthrough</h4>
                        <p>You will use the VizPriv app to take and upload images and videos for the 14 prop objects. Please use the link we sent you earlier from Apple Testflight to download the Vizpriv app. </p>
                        <p>The first time you open the VizPriv app, it will ask you to provide your consent for participating in this research and the collection of your images and videos for the construction of a dataset open to the public. </p>
                        <p>Upon providing the consent, you will be directed to register an account using your unique participant ID code. The ID was sent to you from vizpriv@gmail.com upon completing the pre-survey. You do not need a password.</p>
                        <p>There is a “Contact Us'' button on every page of the app. You can use this button to contact the researchers if you encounter any issues or have any questions. The researchers will try to answer within 30 minutes during work hours (9am-5pm).</p>

                        <h4 id="step2">Step 2: Prop Objects Unboxing and Familiarization</h4>
                        <h5>What are Prop Objects?</h5>
                        <p>You should receive a kit that contains the 14 prop objects from us in mail. Each Prop Object in the kit is an example of private visual content sometimes found in blind people’s images and videos. None of the props contain real private information. In total, the kit contains:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>a local newspaper</li>
                            <li>a fake bank statement</li>
                            <li>a fake bill or receipt</li>
                            <li>a fake business card</li>
                            <li>a condom box</li>
                            <li>a fake credit or debit card</li>
                            <li>a doctor's prescription</li>
                            <li>a letter with address </li>
                            <li>a medical record document </li>
                            <li>a pregnancy test</li>
                            <li>an empty pill bottle </li>
                            <li>a tattoo sleeve </li>
                            <li>a fake transcript </li>
                            <li>a fake mortgage or investment report</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h5>Prop object kit unboxing </h5>
                        <p>Each prop object comes with a package, with a QR code and a braille label on top of it. You can read the braille label to identify each prop object, or use the QR code scanning function in the VizPriv app (see the next step for more information).</p>

                        <h4 id="step3">Step 3: Selection of Prop Object</h4>
                        <p>Here are two options for how to start the photography task with a prop object. </p>

                        <h5>Option 1: through QR code</h5>
                        <p>First, select a random prop object from the kit, and locate the QR code on its package. On the main screen of the VizPriv app, there is an option for you to scan a QR code. Once the app captures a QR code, it will let you know which prop object you are holding, and will take you to the page where you can capture images and videos for this object.</p>

                        <h5>Option 2: through braille label</h5>
                        <p>Alternatively, you can also find a list of 14 prop objects on the main screen of the VizPriv app. Select a prop object from this list to start the photography task, which will lead you to the page where you can capture images and videos for this object. You can then use the braille label on each prop object’s package to find the specific object that you just selected in the app.</p>
                        <p>You are now ready to start the photography task for this selected prop object!</p>

                        <h4 id="step4">Step 4: Foreground and Background Image Task</h4>

                        <h5>What are foreground and background images?</h5>
                        <p>A foreground image refers to an image with the selected prop object as its focus, which means that the object is often the largest, closests item to your camera in the whole image. In contrast, a background image refers to an image with the selected prop object being accidentally captured in the background, which means that the selected prop object is often further away from the camera. In total, you will take 1 foreground image and 1 background image for each of the 14 prop objects in the kit.</p>
                        
                        <h5>Set up and capture foreground Image </h5>
                        <p>Please first take a moment to find a place in your local environment, where you would most likely find the selected prop object. </p>
                        <p>Take an image of the selected prop object at this location in a way that it is the main focus of your image, which means that it should be the closest object to your camera in the whole image. The VizPriv app gives voice instructions for taking foreground images of this selected prop. Follow the instructions and click the “Take Image” button on the VizPriv app.</p>
                        <p>Note: Please try to also capture some background around the prop object, by not zooming in too much on the object. Please also try not to capture any of your own private objects to protect your privacy. </p>
                        <p>Once you capture the image, you will be directed to the background image task.</p>
                        <h5>Set up and capture background Image </h5>
                        <p>Similar to the foreground image task, you will take an image of the selected prop object at a location that you will likely find the object. However, this time, the prop object will be in the background of the image that you take.</p>
                        <p>Please put the prop object further away from you, and take an image of anything surrounding you, with the prop object being in the background. We understand that setting up for a background image may be challenging, and please feel free to let someone help you with this step. But please make sure you do the actual photography (i.e., taking the image or video).</p>
                        <p>Similar to the foreground image, the VizPriv app gives voice instructions to guide you through the task. Follow the instructions and click the “Take Image” button on the app to take the image. </p>
                        <p>Note: Please make sure the prop object is not completely covered by another object. Again, please try not to capture any of your own private objects to protect your privacy.  </p>
                        <p>Once you capture the image, you will be provided the option to upload or retake the foreground and background images in the app. Please go ahead and click “upload” to proceed to the video task for this prop object. Our research team will review the images and reach out to you if any of them needs to be retaken. </p>

                        <h4 id="step5">Step 5: Foreground and Background Video Task</h4>

                        <h5>What are foreground and background videos?</h5>
                        <p>Similar to a foreground image, a foreground video refers to a video with the selected prop object as its focus, which means that the object is often the largest, closests item to your camera in the whole image. In contrast, a background video refers to a video with the selected prop object in the background. These videos can have the same set-up as the images you previously took, and should be 25-seconds long each. In total, you will take 1 foreground video and 1 background video for each of the 14 prop objects in the kit. </p>
                        <h5>Set up and capture foreground video </h5>
                        <p>Similar to the foreground image task, place the selected prop object at a location that you will likely find it, in a way that it is the main focus of your video. </p>
                        <p>To record the 25-seconds video, first press the “record” button to start recording. Then, gradually draw your phone closer to your chest. Once you have reached your chest and hear the 25-seconds notification from the app, click the record button again to stop recording. The VizPriv app gives voice instructions to guide you through the task. If the video reaches 1 minute and you have not stopped the recording, the app will automatically stop the recording. </p>
                        <p>Note: Again, please try not to capture any of your own private objects to protect your privacy. </p>
                        <p>Once you capture the foreground video, you will be directed to the background video task.</p>
                        <h5>Set up and capture background video </h5>
                        <p>Similar to the background image task, you will take a video of the selected prop object at a location that you will likely find it, with the prop object in the background of the video. Again, please feel free to let someone help you with setting this step up.</p>
                        <p>Similar to the foreground video task, press the “record” button to start recording. Then, gradually draw your phone closer to your chest. Once you have reached your chest and hear the 25-seconds notification from the app, click the record button again to stop recording. The VizPriv app gives voice instructions to guide you through the task. If the video reaches 1 minute and you have not stopped the recording, the app will automatically stop the recording. </p>
                        <p>Note: Again, please try not to capture any of your own private objects to protect your privacy. </p>
                        <p>Once you capture the background video, you will be provided the option to upload or re-record the foreground and background videos in the app. Please go ahead and click “upload”. Our research team will review the videos and reach out to you if any of them needs to be re-recorded. </p>
                        <p>When all of the foreground and background images and videos are uploaded for one prop object, the app will show “You successfully completed this task. Go for the next Prop”. The app will also show which prop objects are completed, and which ones are not. </p>
                        <p>To proceed to the next prop object, either select a new prop object from the incomplete list and retrieve the corresponding prop object from the kit using braille on its package, or grab a random new prop object from the kit to follow the QR code scanning procedure. Go through step 3 to 5 again with this new prop, until you are finished with all 14 prop objects. </p>
                        <p>We suggest you put the completed prop objects back to their original packages, and put them away from the incomplete ones to avoid confusion. </p>
                        <h4 id="step6">Step 6: Review and Edit Images and Videos</h4>
                        <p>Once you have uploaded the foreground and background images and videos for all 14 prop objects, researchers will review your uploaded images and videos for any potential issues and inform you if you need to retake any of them through emails. </p>
                        <p>To review and edit your uploaded images and videos, please click on the prop object from the completed object list, which will take you to the page where you can review and retake any images or videos.  </p>
